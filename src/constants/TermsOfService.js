# 1. Service Level Commitment

1.1. Company’s goal is to provide 99.5% uptime with respect to the Services during each calendar month of the Term, excluding Regularly
Scheduled Maintenance (as defined in 1.2 and any Excusable Delay. If in any calendar month an uptime of 99.5% is not met by Company and
Customer was materially negatively impacted (i.e., attempted to log into or access the Services and failed due to the unscheduled downtime of
the Services), Company shall provide, as Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy and Company’s sole and exclusive liability: (i) in the case of
subscription Customers, a service credit equal to five percent (5%) of one month’s fees for the Services. For purposes of this Exhibit A,
“Excusable Delay” means any delay or failure in the Services which is due to causes beyond the reasonable control of either party hereto,
including, but not limited to, issues caused by telecommunications and internet service provider(s), delays or failures involving hardware or
software not within Company’s possession or control, acts of God, acts of the public enemy, acts of any governmental authority in its sovereign
capacity, fires, floods, power outages, hurricanes, earthquakes, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes or other labor disputes and freight
embargoes.

1.2. **Scheduled Maintenance:** Regularly Scheduled Maintenance time does not count as downtime. “Regularly Scheduled Maintenance”
includes (i) planned downtime, which shall be any period outside of the hours of 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday
and 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time Saturday, Sunday, and holidays, and (ii) scheduled maintenance for which Company gives twelve (12)
hours or more notice that the Services will be unavailable.

1.3. **Unscheduled Maintenance:** Company in its sole discretion may take the Services down for unscheduled maintenance and in that event
will attempt to notify Customer in advance. Such unscheduled maintenance will be counted against the uptime guarantee. Customer is solely
responsible for providing, at its own expense, all network access to the Services, including, without limitation, acquiring, installing and
maintaining all telecommunications equipment, hardware, software and other equipment as may be necessary to connect to, access and use the
Services.

1.4. **Exclusive Remedy:** Customers may receive service credits only for up to two calendar months of Fees in any given calendar year. If
Company fails to meet its uptime commitments to Customer in three consecutive months, Customer may terminate this Agreement and will be
entitled to a pro-rated refund of any prepaid, unused Fees. Customer shall not exercise the rights set forth in this Exhibit without a reasonable
basis or belief that the applicable service level commitment was not satisfied. THIS EXHIBIT A SETS FORTH CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AND COMPANY’S ENTIRE LIABILITY, FOR ANY FAILURE TO MEET THE SERVICE LEVEL
COMMITMENT.

# 2. Credit Request
In order to receive a credit under this Service Level Agreement, Customer must request it by emailing Company at support@revops.io within
ten days of the end of the applicable month. If Customer submits a credit request and does not receive a prompt automated response indicating
that the request was received, Customer must resubmit the request because the submission was not properly received and will not result in a
credit. Customers who are past due or in default with respect to any payment or any material contractual obligations to Company are not eligible
for any credit under this Service Level Agreement. Company shall calculate any service level downtime using Company’s system logs and
other records. Service credits will be applied on Customer’s next Company invoice following Company’s receipt of Customer’s request for
credit and Company’s verification that the Service Level was not met.

# 3. Support
3.1 Company will use reasonable efforts to provide (a) Error correction; (b) telephone and email support to a single consistent Customer
support contact (“Designated Support Contact”) concerning the use of the Services; and (c) updates to the Services that Company in its sole
discretion makes generally available to its support and maintenance customers without additional charge (collectively, “Support”). All support
requests must come through the Designated Support Contact. Customer may update the Designated Support Contact by providing written
notice to Company.

3.2 Error Response Times: An “Error” means an error in the Services which significantly degrades the Services as compared to
Company’s standard performance specifications as set forth in Company’s technical documentation for the Services. For each Error reported
by Customer, Company shall (i) assign a priority level to such Error in its discretion in accordance with the table below, and (ii) respond to
Customer and provide status updates in accordance with the time periods set forth in the table below.

| Classification | Description | Response Time | Status Updates |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Priority 1 | The Services are completely unavailable or performance is so poor as to render the Services unusable; or Data security breach or hack (whether actual or suspected) or attempted data security breach. | 1 hour | Every 2 hours |
| Priority 2 | A major functionality of the Services is unusable and results in limited functionality that affects a large number of users. | 2 hours | Every 4 hours |
| Priority 3 | A loss of a function or resource of the Services that does not seriously affect the Services’ functionality. | 1 business day | Each business day |
| Priority 4 | All other problems with the Services other than those that fall within the categories listed above. | One week | TBD on a case-by-case basis |
